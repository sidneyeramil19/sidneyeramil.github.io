  <h4> Hello my name is Sidney
  <br>
    I am the creator of this webiste. I am 14 years old in 9th grade.
    One of my favorite hobbies to do is traveling. 
    I have traveled all over the world to France, Switzerland, Germany,
    Amsterdam, Cancun, Guadelupe, Belgium, and Italy.
    I move often in the U.S and I have been exposed to many different cultures.
    I enjoy spending time with friends and family, play multiplayer video games, 
    arcades, and trying out new tech.
