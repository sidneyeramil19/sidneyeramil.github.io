  <h2>
    Some of the places I would like to visit are Japan, Morocco, Thailand,
    Australia, Singapore, and Egypt. Everytime I travel i'm more interested in the food then anything else. But after food is the culture
    and the way of living. Finally are the items that make the culture unique and different from others.

  <h3>
    Japan is known for samurai's, anime, cosplay, manga, and so much more!!
    I have always wanted to visit japan fascinated by the culture and most of all food. 
    Japan is a technologically advanced country in its urban areas.    
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan">Japan</a> is a culture rich country in terms of food.
    Whenever I visit countries my top prioity is trying out as much food as I can.

  <h3>
    Morroco is a <a href="https://www.africa.com/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-morocco/">North African</a> 
    country bordering the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
    It is full of beautiful market places in which you can find jewelry, ceramics, and metal lanterns. It is rich in culture and diverse 
    with a french influence. I would like to know more about different styles of marketplaces in different countries.
    What makes them different but similar? How do they show their heritage through there products? What type of food do they eat?
